* Update breadcrumb on the Global (home screen) Recently Added content.

* (*) "Info Button" now works in Video Details Screen
    - It will activate the "more..." button dialog
     - In the dialog, the (*) will close dialog
    - Initial addition, so let me know your thoughts

* Cast and Crew for Movies: Check out the MORE button / "Cast & Crew"
    - Display a list of Actors/Directors/Producers and Writers for selected Movie
    - Persons poster will be displayed if your PMS has a URL for them (depends on the scaper)
    - Select a person to get a list of movies/content with them
    - Listed content will show Server/Section name on the top right
    - NOTE: people searches only work in the PMS by sections for now
            This also doesn't work for TV shows yet. That's a PMS thing..

    - Play All Button (plays from selected video to the end of the list)
    - Navigation - You can click left/right in the Video Details Screen for the previous or next trailer
    - Video Length is now available. HUD has End Time & Time Watched

    - I suggest to never use this unless you are testing with me

* Fix: Breadcrumbs updated when selecting "All Seasons of {ShowTitle}" or "Season {#}" insead of just diplaying "Series"
* Fix: Recently Added (unwatched), Recently Released (unwatched) rows could not be hidden
* Fix: Depending on how one entered a TV Episode, the more button wouldn't exist due to data missing from the PMS response. We now obtain the needed info another way when missing.


### 2.6.11-test

* RARflix Preferences section: my mods that haven't made it into the Official Channel will usually be here
* Hide Rows: you can now hide rows instead of reordering them, which you can still do too. ( not per section though )
* Ability to toggle all modes ( well most of them )
* TV Titles watched status: will include (watched) or ( # of # watched) or (#)  for TV shows. Not really new, but some fixes added and of course a Toggle to turn it off
* Toggle for the Clock
* Added 2 more rows: (only applies to movies)  -- TV is possible, but the PMS is currently way to slow to filter results
   1) Recenlty Released (unwatched)
   2) Recenlty Added (unwatched)
* HUD: display current time and time watched when video duration is unavailable ( usually queue videos, some channels, trailers )
* SlideShow Overlay toggle:  toggle for text overlay during slideshow (down button) -- request
* Merged Schuyler's updates from the PlexTest (v2.6.9) channel: http://forums.plexap...ku/#entry465759

* fix: Remove "invalid" from HUD when Release Date is unavailable ( usually queue videos, some channels, trailers )
* fix: Ability to delete queue items (only affected rarflix/rarflixtest )
* fix: When browsing the global on deck (non shared users) entering a movie would allow you to click left or right.
       If the next option was not a movie, you were given the option to "play" the content which would result in a crash.
       Now we just limit the ability to click left or right - not really a complete fix, but will stop an accidental crash.
       (bug seen in official channel too)
* fix: Crash when clicking the play button on a Photo folder (bug was only present in rarflixtest)
