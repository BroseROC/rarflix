* (*) "Info Button" now works in Video Details Screen
    - It will activate the "more..." button dialog
     - In the dialog, the (*) will close dialog
    - Initial addition, so let me know your thoughts

    - NOTE: people searches only work in the PMS by sections for now

### 2.6.11-test

* RARflix Preferences section: my mods that haven't made it into the Official Channel will usually be here
* Hide Rows: you can now hide rows instead of reordering them, which you can still do too. ( not per section though )
* Ability to toggle all modes ( well most of them )
* TV Titles watched status: will include (watched) or ( # of # watched) or (#)  for TV shows. Not really new, but some fixes added and of course a Toggle to turn it off
* Toggle for the Clock
* Added 2 more rows: (only applies to movies)  -- TV is possible, but the PMS is currently way to slow to filter results
   1) Recenlty Released (unwatched)
   2) Recenlty Added (unwatched)
* HUD: display current time and time watched when video duration is unavailable ( usually queue videos, some channels, trailers )
* SlideShow Overlay toggle:  toggle for text overlay during slideshow (down button) -- request
* Merged Schuyler's updates from the PlexTest (v2.6.9) channel: http://forums.plexap...ku/#entry465759

* fix: Remove "invalid" from HUD when Release Date is unavailable ( usually queue videos, some channels, trailers )
* fix: Ability to delete queue items (only affected rarflix/rarflixtest )
* fix: When browsing the global on deck (non shared users) entering a movie would allow you to click left or right.
       If the next option was not a movie, you were given the option to "play" the content which would result in a crash.
       Now we just limit the ability to click left or right - not really a complete fix, but will stop an accidental crash.
       (bug seen in official channel too)
* fix: Crash when clicking the play button on a Photo folder (bug was only present in rarflixtest)
